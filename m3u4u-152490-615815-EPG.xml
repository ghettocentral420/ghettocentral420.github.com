As punishment, they are forced to escort a pair of socialites (Anne Dudek, Rochelle Aytes) to the Hamptons, where they're going to be used as bait for a kidnapper. But when the girls realize the FBI's plan, they refuse to go. Left without options, Marcus and Kevin decide to pose as the sisters, transforming themselves from African-American men into a pair of blonde, white women.</desc>

"The Price Is Right" -- hosted by Bob Barker until 2007 and Drew Carey thereafter -- features a wide variety of games and contests with the same basic challenge: Guess the prices of everyday (or not-quite-everyday) retail items. Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the "Showcase Showdown." That's repeated in the second half of the show, and two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. Models present the prizes.</desc>

<title lang="en">Card Sharks</title>
<desc lang="en">This show from legendary Mark Goodson-Bill Todman Productions features two contestants trying to predict answers to survey questions for the opportunity to play a game with oversized playing cards for a chance to win cash. One contestant guesses how many people (out of 100) gave a certain answer to a question and the other contestant then guesses if the number is higher or lower than the opponent's guess. The winning contestant then faces a row of cards and must determine if each succeeding card is higher or lower than the one that precedes it. The contestant who wins two out of three games wins the match and plays the bonus round, called Money Cards. The Money Cards round is similar to the card game in the main game but with three levels of cards instead of one row. The contestant is given $200 at the beginning of Money Cards and wagers any or all of that money when guessing if the cards will be higher or lower than the previous one. A perfect round could earn the contestant $28,800.</desc>

Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the "Showcase Showdown." That's repeated in the second half of the show, and two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. Models present the prizes.</desc>

<desc lang="en">Based on novels by Maureen Jennings, "Murdoch Mysteries" follows young detective William Murdoch. In a series of stories taking place in Toronto during the 1890s and early 1900s, several challenging murder cases arise. Murdoch uses up-and-coming forensics techniques and an unconventional approach, which often elicit skepticism from his fellow officers and his boss. Coroner Julia Ogden becomes Murdoch's number one ally, and they make a top-notch team, but he must struggle against tradition and prejudice to solve some of the city's most-gruesome murders.</desc>

<desc lang="en">The Emmy-winning "Inside the NFL" series has been going strong for well over 40 years and has called several networks its home in that time. The cast may change every few years, with various hosts and analysts offering their take on football action, but the content has remained fairly consistent since its 1977 debut. In-depth highlights of that week's games, feature segments, and predictions are still the core of the show airing weekly during the NFL season and through the postseason. In 2014 wide receiver Brandon Marshall became an analyst, the first active player to serve in the role in the program's history.</desc>

<desc lang="en">The Emmy-winning "Inside the NFL" series has been going strong for well over 40 years and has called several networks its home in that time. The cast may change every few years, with various hosts and analysts offering their take on football action, but the content has remained fairly consistent since its 1977 debut. In-depth highlights of that week's games, feature segments, and predictions are still the core of the show airing weekly during the NFL season and through the postseason. In 2014 wide receiver Brandon Marshall became an analyst, the first active player to serve in the role in the program's history.</desc>

<desc lang="en">In the Southwest during the Civil War, a mysterious stranger, Joe (Clint Eastwood), and a Mexican outlaw, Tuco (Eli Wallach), form an uneasy partnership -- Joe turns in the bandit for the reward money, then rescues him just as he is being hanged. When Joe's shot at the noose goes awry during one escapade, a furious Tuco tries to have him murdered. The men re-team abruptly, however, to beat out a sadistic criminal and the Union army and find $20,000 that a soldier has buried in the desert.</desc>

<title lang="">Hidden Killers of the Post-War Home</title>
<desc lang="">Dr Suzannah Lipscomb reveals some of the unexpected dangers lurking in the ever-changing homes of Britain in the 1950s. For the first time, moulded plywood furniture, fibreglass, plastics and polyester were becoming fixtures of domestic life, having all been developed and created during the Second World War. However, even as this bright new era of social change progressed, bringing higher living standards and improved technologies, new, unprecedented hazards were finding their way into everyday life

<desc lang="en">Veteran writer, reporter and radio personality Paul Finebaum built a legion of loyal sports fans as the "Voice of the SEC" during 20 years hosting his Birmingham, Ala.-based radio talk show. When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur. The show airs weekday afternoons throughout the year on SEC Network.</desc>

When ESPN launched the SEC Network in 2014, it was only natural that Finebaum became its first on-air hire, bringing his radio show -- and those passionate followers -- with him. Now originating from one of the SEC Network studios in Charlotte, N.C., the show is a forum for lively discussion and debate of all things SEC and across the spectrum of college sports, with Finebaum playing the role of both moderator and provocateur. The show airs weekday afternoons throughout the year on SEC Network.</desc>
