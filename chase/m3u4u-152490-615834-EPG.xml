<desc lang="en">Created in 1997 by veteran journalist Barbara Walters, "The View" is a daytime talk show hosted by women -- including Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Sunny Hostin, Sara Haines, Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro -- and each offers her take on the day's news during the opening "Hot Topics" segment. Later, the ladies welcome various celebrities, who join them in a chat or perform for the audience. The program also offers tips on beauty, fashion, diet and relationships. Known for their freewheeling style, the hosts are often lampooned in late-night sketches.</desc>

<title lang="en">Let's Make a Deal</title>
<desc lang="en">CBS adds to its daytime game-show lineup with an updated version of the classic TV show of the 1960s, filmed in Los Angeles. Hosted by comic/singer/actor Wayne Brady, contestants -- often dressed in a wide variety of original costumes -- will still compete for money and prizes by striking wacky deals. Jonathan Mangum is the show's announcer, and Monty Hall, arguably the best-known host of the earlier version of the show, is listed among the new show's creative consultants. The program won a Daytime Creative Arts Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song in 2014 for "30,000 Reasons to Love Me," composed by Cat Gray and performed by Wayne Brady.</desc>

<title lang="en">The Price Is Right</title>
<desc lang="en">"Come on down!" "The Price Is Right" -- hosted by Bob Barker until 2007 and Drew Carey thereafter -- features a wide variety of games and contests with the same basic challenge: Guess the prices of everyday (or not-quite-everyday) retail items. Four contestants, all of whom are seated in one of the wildest audiences in daytime game-show history, are called to the stage to play a preliminary pricing round. That winner joins the host on stage for one of more than 70 different pricing games. After three such games, the contestants spin a big wheel -- hoping to get as close to $1 as possible -- in the "Showcase Showdown." That's repeated in the second half of the show, and two highest winners of that round advance to the final, where prizes could be cars or roomsful of furniture. Models present the prizes.</desc>
